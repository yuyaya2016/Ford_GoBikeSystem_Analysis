## Highlights

**1. The performances of customers/subscribers, in terms of time of day, day of the week, and month of a year**
<br>
Looking to user behavior through the time of a day, for subscribers, there are two prefer time segments they ride bikes, which are 7:00 - 9:00 and 16:00 - 18:00. While for customers, they have more consistent using time, and the peak is around 17:00. In terms of the day of a month, subscribers often ride bikes during weekday, from Monday to Friday, while customers prefer to rider bike on weekends. As for the month of a year, subscribers tend to ride bikes from summer to fall, especially on October and customers also use bike on summer more frequently.

**2. The duration distribution of customer / subscriber**<br>
Look deeper into those who ride bikes under 3000 sec and plot the 30 min line to see how many people ride overtime. According to the above plot, most of people use bike within 5-10 minutes. They might only use bikes for the short-distance trip.
